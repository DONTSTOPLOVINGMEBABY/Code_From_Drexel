3/13

	I thought that this was a really interesting homework. It helped solidify my knowledge of threads and how to handle them. I thought this was an interesting 
	assignment because I like the idea of threads and running concurrent processes. It seems like something that will be very usefull later and I am glad I am 
	learning it now. For this assignment we had to fix the code that was given to use threads. This was somewhat challenging. For me the challenge was trying to
	figure out how I was going to solve the problem. I got the big things out of the way like creating the thread and join the threads. That was easy but the dotprod
	was a new one for me since I have not taken Calc2 or 3. So this was a new concept for me. I would recommend this assignment to future students. I think it 
	holds so important lessons and is just the right difficulty. I think that the assignment was successful in teaching me about signals and concurrent processes. 
	Overall I really enjoyed this assignment.
