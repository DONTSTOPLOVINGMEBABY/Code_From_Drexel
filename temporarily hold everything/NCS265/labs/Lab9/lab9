2.1 I received a segmentation fault (core dumped) error and a new file named 'core' was created. 


2.2 It bombed in the strcmp function, which was called in the inTable function. 



2.3


c. I received the same error as before (which was a segmentation fualt error). In order to get it to work, I defined an array of characters named st so we would be able to access the st arraay. 


f. Program received signal SIGSEV, Segmentation fault, which means our program was trying to write memory that we did not have memory to. 


2.4 Our program suffers from a logic error that does not affect the code at compile time. This is why we are able to compile the program, but are unsucessful in running it. 


2.5 If we accidentally pass a string comparison to a function, the function will exit and our program will terminate.
