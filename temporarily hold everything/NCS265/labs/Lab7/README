Lab 7 README


I completed four of the eight questions for this lab, and the code for these problems is written in the file "lab7". For question 2.3, the program compiles and runs how it is suppose to. When I compile it, I receive a warning, but the program still runs fine. Thanks for taking the time to read and grade my lab.
