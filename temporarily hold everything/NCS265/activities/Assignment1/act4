Activity 4


1. To protect from the shell so the entire command can be passed to awk. This means you cannot single quotes within the command passed to awk. 


2. sed '/\<the\>/ d' s1


3. Doesn't need quotes because there are no special characters, and sed automatically recognizes s/ as a parameter for the command. 


4. sed '/<head>/,/<\/head>/ { s/Kurt/Vera/g}' s1
