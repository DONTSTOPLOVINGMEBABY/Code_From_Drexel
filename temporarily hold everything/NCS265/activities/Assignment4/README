Professor Schmidt, 

You asked that I submit a README to you in lieu of the activity today. I had to run right after we finished the meeting. I came home (back to Florida) yesterday, and have been running around nonstop for the past week. I will look over the activity sometime this week or over the weekend. See you in class. 

Henry
