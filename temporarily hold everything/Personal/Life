What a special life we live

What a special life I live

I am truly happy for having those around me, and for myself

For this day

And for all the things I have realized in this life

Things that we miss. 


Things that I miss. 

Theren are things you can't picture you're life without
or maybe you just don't. 

People are different. You can't blame them for the what they like, and who they are. 

Love and live easy. 


A break in the way things are

A break in the way things have been. 

Somethings have to change. 

Somethings seem to be in a constant state of change, 

But everything is impermanent.
